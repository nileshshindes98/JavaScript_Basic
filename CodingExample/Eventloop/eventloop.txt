eventloop-event loop continuously checks for tasks in a queue and executes them one by one 
when the stack is free

in this event loop their is few step :
 
callback- that keeps track of the currently executing function ,Each time a function is
 called, a new stack frame is added to the top of the call stack, and when a function completes, its 
 corresponding stack frame is removed from the stack

callback queue- Asynchronous operations (like setTimeout,callback) are not executed 
 immediately. Instead, their callbacks are placed in a callback queue when they are ready to be executed

micro queue- it is same as callback queue but it store high priority (like promise) function to be executed 
when stack is free

eventloop-The event loop continuously checks two main things (1) callstack (2)callback queue
 If the call stack is empty, and there are pending callbacks in the callback queue, the event loop 
 will move a callback from the queue to the call stack, allowing it to be executed
